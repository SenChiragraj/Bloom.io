# Bloom.io

Project Description: The Full Stack Blog App is a powerful web application developed using the MERN (MongoDB, Express, React, Node.js) stack, designed to offer a comprehensive and secure platform for creating, managing, and interacting with blog content. At its core, the app features complete authentication and authorization mechanisms driven by JSON Web Tokens (JWT), ensuring a robust security infrastructure.

The app's standout features include user registration and authentication, where users can securely register and subsequently log in using their unique credentials. This authentication process is fortified by JWT, which facilitates secure communication between the client and the server. Through this token-based approach, the app authorizes users to access protected routes, thereby thwarting unauthorized entry and bolstering data security.
